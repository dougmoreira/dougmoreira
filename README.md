# Hi there, I'm Douglas Moreira ðŸ‘‹

I'm a iOS Software Engineer based in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. I'm passionate about building great user experiences and creating robust applications.

## ðŸ”­ Main Repositories

Below are some of my main repositories. Feel free to explore them and check out my work!
- [WIP - Adopting SwiftUI with a Bottom-Up Approach to Minimize Risk](https://github.com/dougmoreira/WeatherApp-SwiftUI): Adopting SwiftUI with a bottom-up approach is better because it minimizes risk by being less disruptive, while allowing for incremental improvements.

- [Testing API Layer](https://github.com/dougmoreira/ExampleAppWithVIPER): is a project where I demonstrate my knowledge of Unit Testing by creating an iOS application and testing its API layer. In this repository, I show how I build a robust and reliable app by testing the API layer with Unit Tests. The API layer is tested to ensure that it functions as expected and that the app behaves correctly in different scenarios. This project serves as a great example of how Unit Testing can be used to create high-quality and maintainable applications. Feel free to explore the code and see how it works!

## ðŸ“š Currently Learning

- [iOS LEAD ESSENTIALS PROGRAM](https://www.essentialdeveloper.com/): I'm currently enrolled in the iOS LEAD ESSENTIALS PROGRAM from Essential Developer, learning best practices for iOS software development and team leadership.

- [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/): I'm currently learning SwiftUI to build modern and responsive user interfaces for iOS applications.
